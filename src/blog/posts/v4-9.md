# v4.9: Huge performance improvements, try version 5 preview

In Dark Reader 4.9.9 we've done enormous amount of **performance improvements**.
The loading speed of some huge web pages has increased **5x times**.
Firefox users should now get nearly the same experience as Chrome users have.

That means the loading speed when Dark Reader is activated should be about the same as without it.
For those users who have slow computers we will keep improving **Static mode**.
**Filter mode** can be used as a workaround too.

We keep working on Dark Reader version 5 release.
To make the transition smooth all engine improvements and **new features**
are available in the current app instance.

To **activate the new user interface** do the following:
- Click Dark Reader **icon**.
- Click **Dev tools** (in the bottom-right corner).
- Click **Preview new design**.

Some of the most requested features are **already available** in version 4.9.11:
- Custom background, text and selection colors (under **Theme** click **See all options**, **Colors**).
- Ability to disable scroll bar styling (under **Theme** click **See all options**, **Colors**).
- Ability to disable the extension for PDFs (click **Settings**, **Enable for PDF files**).
- Easier way to find automation options (click **Settings**, **Automation**).
- Ability to import and export settings (click **Settings**, **Manage settings**).

Feel free to suggest a feature you cannot live without.
